      "context": "Title: Ancient Egyptian race controversy\n The question of the race of ancient Egyptians was raised historically as a product of the early racial concepts of the 18th and 19th centuries, and was linked to models of racial hierarchy primarily based on craniometry, anthropometry and genetics.  A variety of views circulated about the racial identity of the Egyptians and the source of their culture.  These were typically identified in terms of a distinction between the Caucasoid and Negroid racial categories.  Some scholars argued that ancient Egyptian culture was influenced by other Afroasiatic-speaking populations in Northeast Africa, the Maghreb or the Middle East, while others pointed to influences from various Nubian groups or populations in Europe. \n Title: Anubis Shrine\n The Anubis Shrine was part of the grave gods of Tutankhamun (18th Dynasty, New Kingdom).  The tomb (KV62) was discovered almost intact on 4 November 1922 in the Valley of the Kings in west Thebes by Howard Carter.  Today the object, with the find number 261, is an exhibit at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, with the inventory number JE 61444. \n Title: Music technology\n Music technology is the use of any device, mechanism, machine or tool by a musician or composer to make or perform music; to compose, notate, play back or record songs or pieces; or to analyze or edit music.  The earliest known applications of technology to music was prehistoric peoples' use of a tool to hand-drill holes in bones to make simple flutes.  Ancient Egyptians developed stringed instruments, such as harps, lyres and lutes, which required making thin strings and some type of peg system for adjusting the pitch of the strings.  Ancient Egyptians also used wind instruments such as double clarinets and percussion instruments such as cymbals.  In Ancient Greece, instruments included the double-reed aulos and the lyre.  Numerous instruments are referred to in the Bible, including the horn, pipe, lyre, harp, and bagpipe.  During Biblical times, the cornet, flute, horn, organ, pipe, and trumpet were also used.  During the Middle Ages, music notation was used to create a written record of the notes of plainchant melodies. \n Title: Lime mortar\n Lime mortar is composed of lime and an aggregate such as sand, mixed with water.  The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use lime mortars.  About 6,000 years ago, they used lime to plaster the pyramids at Giza.  In addition, the Egyptians also incorporated various limes into their religious temples as well as their homes.  Indian traditional structures built with lime mortar, which are more than 4,000 years old like Mohanjo-Daro is still a heritage monument of Indian civilization.  It is one of the oldest known types of mortar also used in ancient Rome and Greece, when it largely replaced the clay and gypsum mortars common to ancient Egyptian construction. \n Title: Flooding of the Nile\n The flooding of the Nile (Arabic: عيد وفاء النيل‎ ‎ ) has been an important natural cycle in Egypt since ancient times.  It is celebrated by Egyptians as an annual holiday for two weeks starting August 15, known as \"Wafaa El-Nil\".  It is also celebrated in the Coptic Church by ceremonially throwing a martyr's relic into the river, hence the name, Esba` al-shahīd (\"The Martyr's Finger\").  Ancient Egyptians believed that the Nile flooded every year because of Isis's tears of sorrow for her dead husband, Osiris. \n Title: Beauty and cosmetics in ancient Egypt\n The ancient Egyptians regarded beauty as a sign of holiness.  Everything the ancient Egyptians used had a spiritual aspect to it, including cosmetics, which is why cosmetics were an integral part of their daily lives.  Traders traded makeup often, especially in the upper classes.  In tombs, cosmetic palettes were found buried with the deceased as grave goods which further emphasized the idea that cosmetics were not only used for aesthetic purposes but rather magical and religious purposes. \n Title: Thebes, Egypt\n Thebes (Ancient Greek: Θῆβαι , \"Thēbai\"), known to the ancient Egyptians as Waset, was an ancient Egyptian city located east of the Nile about 800 km south of the Mediterranean.  Its ruins lie within the modern Egyptian city of Luxor.  Thebes was the main city of the fourth Upper Egyptian nome (Sceptre nome) and was the capital of Egypt during the New Kingdom.  It was close to Nubia and the eastern desert, with its valuable mineral resources and trade routes.  It was a cult center and the wealthiest city of ancient Egypt at its heyday.  The site of Thebes includes areas on both the eastern bank of the Nile, where the temples of Karnak and Luxor stand and the city proper was situated; and the western bank, where a necropolis of large private and royal cemeteries and funerary complexes can be found. \n Title: Canopic jar\n Canopic jars were used by the ancient Egyptians during the mummification process to store and preserve the viscera of their owner for the afterlife.  They were commonly either carved from limestone or were made of pottery.  These jars were used by the ancient Egyptians from the time of the Old Kingdom until the time of the Late Period or the Ptolemaic Period, by which time the viscera were simply wrapped and placed with the body.  The viscera were not kept in a single canopic jar: each jar was reserved for specific organs.  The name \"canopic\" reflects the mistaken association by early Egyptologists with the Greek legend of Canopus. \n Title: Herodotus Machine\n The Herodotus Machine was a machine described by Herodotus, a Greek historian born in Halicarnassus, Caria (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey).  Herodotus claims this invention enabled the Ancient Egyptians to construct the pyramids.  The contraption supposedly allowed workers to lift heavy building materials.  Herodotus is believed to have encountered the device while traveling through Egypt.  With limited reference and no true schematics, this machine has stimulated many historians' theories of how the Ancient Egyptians were able to create pyramids. \n Title: Music technology (mechanical)\n Mechanical music technology is the use of any device, mechanism, machine or tool by a musician or composer to make or perform music; to compose, notate, play back or record songs or pieces; or to analyze or edit music.  The earliest known applications of technology to music was prehistoric peoples' use of a tool to hand-drill holes in bones to make simple flutes.  Ancient Egyptians developed stringed instruments, such as harps, lyres and lutes, which required making thin strings and some type of peg system for adjusting the pitch of the strings.  Ancient Egyptians also used wind instruments such as double clarinets and percussion instruments such as cymbals.  In Ancient Greece, instruments included the double-reed aulos and the lyre.  Numerous instruments are referred to in the Bible, including the horn, pipe, lyre, harp, and bagpipe.  During Biblical times, the cornet, flute, horn, organ, pipe, and trumpet were also used.  During the Middle Ages, hand-written music notation was developed to write down the notes of religious Plainchant melodies; this notation enabled the Catholic church to disseminate the same chant melodies across its entire empire. \n",

      "context": "Title: Wind controller\n A wind controller, sometimes referred to as a \"wind synth\", or \"wind synthesizer\", is a wind instrument capable of controlling one or more music synthesizers or other devices.  Wind controllers are most commonly played and fingered like a woodwind instrument, usually the saxophone, with the next most common being brass fingering, particularly the trumpet.  Models have been produced that play and finger like other acoustic instruments such as the recorder or the tin whistle.  One form of wind controller, the hardware-based variety, uses electronic sensors to convert fingering, breath pressure, bite pressure, finger pressure, and other gesture information into control signals.  Another form of wind controller uses software to convert the acoustic sound of an unmodified wind instrument directly into MIDI messages.  In either case, the control signals or MIDI messages generated by the wind controller are used to control internal or external devices such as analog synthesizers or MIDI-compatible synthesizers, softsynths, sequencers, or even lighting systems. \n Title: Electric instrument\n An electric musical instrument is one in which the use of electric devices determines or affects the sound produced by an instrument.  Electric musical instruments are an example of electric music technology.

The instrument, which translated means \"mother duck flute\" is very simple, as it primarily uses a large partially flattened tube reed connected to a thin cylindrical pipe (which may or may not have a small brass bell.)  A similar to the southern Chinese Luguan and Houguan, it is made of bamboo, instead of hardwood and uses a softer reed, giving it a more nasal buzzing sound than that of the northern Chinese guanzi which is hardwood with are harder reed.  This design also limits the instrument to a little more than an octave in range, since it cannot overblow like the guanzi.  It is primarily used in Taiwanese Folk opera for its somber sound.  Although native of Taiwan, it is becoming an increasingly popular instrument in China as well. \n Title: Thiruvalaputhur T A Kaliyamurthy\n Kalaimamani Thiruvalaputhur T A Kaliyamurthy (born October 22, 1948) is a famous Thavil artist providing 'special' Thavil accompaniment ('Special' in percussion circles denotes selection-grade status and seniority) to the Nagaswaram maestros. \n Title: Stock-and-horn\n The stock-and-horn was a traditional instrument of the Scottish peasantry, very similar to the Welsh pibgorn, consisting of a single-reed reed pipe amplified by a bell made of horn.  The original instrument of the Middle Ages had a double chanter with single reeds but was replaced by the single chanter type.  The single chanter instrument is described in great detail by Robert Burns in a 1794 letter to a contemporary; Burns describes how he had much difficulty coming by the instrument, and notes that it has six or seven fingerholes on the top, one on the back, and is played with a single reed (\"oaten reed\") unfixed to the instrument but held by the lips. \n Title: Musical ensemble\n A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name.  Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra.  Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups.  In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers.  In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet).  Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. \n Title: Music lesson\n Music lessons are a type of formal instruction in playing a musical instrument or singing.  Typically, a student taking music lessons meets a music teacher for one-on-one training sessions ranging from 30 minutes to one hour in length over a period of weeks or years.  For vocal lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand and breathe, and how to position the head, chest, and mouth for good vocal tone.  For instrument lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand with the instrument, how to hold the instrument, and how to manipulate the fingers and other body parts to produce tones and sounds from the instrument.  Music teachers also assign technical exercises, musical pieces, and other activities to help the students improve their musical skills.  While most music lessons are one-on-one (private), some teachers also teach groups of two to four students (semi-private lessons), and, for very basic instruction, some instruments are taught in large group lessons, such as piano and acoustic guitar.  Since the widespread availability of high speed.  low latency Internet, private lessons can also take place through live video chat using webcams, microphones and videotelephony online. \n Title: Instrument Schedule\n In theatrical productions, an instrument schedule is a listing of all the lighting instruments and information about them used in a show.  The instruments are organized by their position on-stage, and is the distinguishing characteristic between an instrument schedule and a channel hookup or similar paperwork.  The instrument schedule includes all information about every instrument, including hanging location, instrument number, type, wattage, color, focus area, circuit, dimmer and templates, along with any additional information.  The variety of information included in an instrument schedule generally makes this more \"complete\" than other generated paperwork, and as such the schedule is often considered the \"master\" sheet.  The master electrician uses the information contained in the instrument schedule along with the light plot to direct the hanging of the instruments. \n Title: Khim\n The Khim (Khmer: ឃឹម \"Khum\";Thai: ขิม, ];) is a stringed musical instrument that is from Persia, called Hammered Dulcimer or Cimbalon.  This Khim was introduced to Cambodia, Laos and Thailand from China, where a similar (though, since the late 20th century, usually larger) instrument is called \"yangqin\".  This instrument is also known as Santur in India.  It is played with two flexible bamboo sticks with soft leather at the tips to produce a soft tone.  This instrument can be played by either sitting down on the floor with the khim on the floor, or by sitting on a chair or standing while the Khim is on a stand.  The khim produces a bright and expressive sound when played.  It is made of wood, with brass strings that are laid across the instrument.  The Australian-born musician and vocal artist Lisa Gerrard specialises in the use of a khim hammered dulcimer, featuring its music on several albums and performing with the instrument live on tour. \n Title: Thavil\n The thavil (Tamil:தவில்) or tavil is a barrel (drum) shaped heavy hand percussion instrument from Tamil Nadu.  It is used in temple, folk and Carnatic music, often accompanying the \"nadaswaram\".  The \"thavil\" and the \"nadaswaram\" are essential components of traditional festivals and ceremonies in South India. \n",

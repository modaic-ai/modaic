    Next, you will complete a table-related question answering task. Based on the provided materials such as the table content (in Markdown format), you need to analyze the User Query.
    And try to decide whether the User Input Query should be broken down into subqueries. You are provided with "solve_subquery" tool that can get answer for the subqueries.
    After you have collected sufficient information, you need to generate comprehensive answers.

    Instructions:
    1. Carefully analyze each user query through step-by-step reasoning.
    2. If the query needs information more than the given table contentï¼š
        - Decompose the query into subqueries.
        - Process one subquery at a time.
        - Use "solve_subquery" tool to get answers for each subquey.
    3. If a query can be answered by table content, do not decompose it. And directly put the orignal query into the "solve_subquery" tool.
        The "solve_subquery" tool utilizes SQL execution inside, it can solve complex subquery on table through one tool call.
    4. Generate exactly ONE subquery at a time.
    5. Write out all terms completely - avoid using abbreviations.
    6. When you have sufficient information, provide the final answer in the following format:
        <Answer>: [your complete response]
    Please start!

Programs define inference strategies to perform tasks. There are two main types of programs in dspy
**Built-in Programs**
These are programs built in to the dspy library. They take in a signature as well as some other arguments and return a `Prediction` type containing the output fields of the base Signature. Some popular built-in programs are
- `Predict`: Simple LM call. 
- `ReAct`: Standard tool calling agent loop
- `ChainOfThought`: Chain of thought reasoning loop

**User Defined Programs**
These are programs that you define yourself by subclassing `dspy.Module` they do not need to take in a signature in their constructor and they can use any combination of built-in and user defined programs to perform tasks.

## Prediction
The `dspy.Prediction` object is the standard return type for all DSPy modules. It acts like a dictionary or a simple object where the keys are the output fields defined in the signature.

When you call a module, it returns a `Prediction` containing:
- **Output Fields**: Any fields defined on the right side of the `->` in your signature (e.g., `answer`).
- **Injected Fields**: Modules like `ChainOfThought` inject additional fields like `reasoning`.
- **Metadata**: Access to completions and LM usage.

```python
# Accessing fields
print(prediction.answer)
# or
print(prediction["answer"])

# Getting LM usage (if enabled)
print(prediction.get_lm_usage())
```

## Built in programs
Below are the major built in programs in dspy. For more see [Extra Programs](../extras/programs.mdx) section.

### Predict
The most basic module. It performs a simple completion based on the provided signature without any additional reasoning steps.

```python
predict = dspy.Predict("question -> answer")
result = predict(question="What is the capital of France?")
print(result.answer)
# >>> Paris
```

### ChainOfThought
An extension of `Predict` that adds a reasoning step. It instructs the LM to think step-by-step before producing the final answer. This is often more accurate for complex tasks.

```python
cot = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
result = cot(question="Why is the sky blue?")
print(result.reasoning) # The reasoning step
print(result.answer)    # The final answer
```

### ReAct
Implements the "Reasoning and Acting" paradigm. It iteratively reasons about a task and decides which tools to call to gather more information.

```python
def search_tool(query: str) -> str:
    # A mock search tool
    return "The capital of France is Paris."

react = dspy.ReAct("question -> answer", tools=[search_tool])
result = react(question="What is the capital of France?")
print(result.answer)
```

### RLM (experimental)
The **Recursive Language Model** (RLM) is designed for exploring massive contexts that exceed typical context windows. It provides the LLM with a sandboxed Python REPL to programmatically explore, filter, and sample data before submitting an answer.

```python
rlm = dspy.RLM("context, query -> answer")
result = rlm(
    context="...huge 1GB dataset reference...", 
    query="Summarize the key trends"
)
print(result.answer)
```


## Custom Module
To define your own dspy module subclass `dspy.Module` and implement the `forward` method.
```python
class MyModule(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.predict = dspy.Predict("input -> output")
    def forward(self, input: str) -> str:
        return self.predict(input=input)

my_module = MyModule()
my_module(input="Who is the 1st president of the United States?")
>>> Prediction(output="George Washington")
```

title: Tools
---

You can use tools in DSPy through the automated `dspy.ReAct` module or by manually defining them within your signatures.

## Reasoning and Acting (ReAct)

The most common way to use tools in DSPy is via the `dspy.ReAct` module. It implements the **ReAct** pattern, where the model interleaves "Thoughts" (reasoning steps) and "Actions" (tool calls) to solve a problem.

`dspy.ReAct` is a generalized module that works over any signature. It automatically handles the loop of reasoning, tool selection, argument generation, and observation processing.

### Example: A ReAct Agent

```python
import dspy

# 1. Define your tools as regular Python functions with docstrings
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a city."""
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny and 75°F"

def search_web(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web for information."""
    return f"Search results for '{query}': [relevant information...]"

# 2. Initialize the ReAct agent with a signature and list of tools
react_agent = dspy.ReAct(
    signature="question -> answer",
    tools=[get_weather, search_web],
    max_iters=5
)

# 3. Use the agent
result = react_agent(question="What's the weather like in Tokyo?")
print(f"Answer: {result.answer}")
print(f"Trajectory: {result.trajectory}")
```

## Manual Tools and ToolCalls API

For developers who need fine-grained control, DSPy offers the `dspy.Tool` and `dspy.ToolCalls` primitives. This is useful when you want to handle tool execution logic yourself or integrate with custom orchestration.

### Key Components

*   **`dspy.Tool`**: A wrapper for Python functions that extracts metadata (name, description, arguments) to present to the model.
*   **`dspy.ToolCalls`**: A special output type that represents the model's request to call one or more tools.
*   **`call.execute()`**: A method on tool call objects to run the underlying function (available in DSPy 3.0.4b2+).

### Example: Manual Tool Execution

```python
import dspy

# Define a signature that expects tools and returns tool calls
class ToolSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Solve the question using the provided tools."""
    question: str = dspy.InputField()
    tools: list[dspy.Tool] = dspy.InputField()
    outputs: dspy.ToolCalls = dspy.OutputField()

# Functions to be used as tools
def calculator(expression: str) -> str:
    """Evaluate a mathematical expression."""
    return str(eval(expression))

# Create tool instances
tools = [dspy.Tool(calculator)]

# Create the predictor
predictor = dspy.Predict(ToolSignature)

# Get the prediction
response = predictor(
    question="What is 15 * 45?",
    tools=tools
)

# Manually execute the returned tool calls
for call in response.outputs.tool_calls:
    result = call.execute(functions=tools)
    print(f"Tool: {call.name} | Result: {result}")
```

## Choosing Your Approach

| Feature | `dspy.ReAct` | Manual API |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Complexity** | Low (Automated) | High (Full control) |
| **Multi-step** | Built-in loop | Requires manual loop |
| **Error Handling** | Automatic retries | Custom implementation |
| **Best For** | Conversational agents | Custom workflows, low-latency |

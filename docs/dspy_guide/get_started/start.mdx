DSPy is a library that enables you to program LLMs instead of just prompting them. In DSPy, you define a schema containing the instructions for your LM, the expected inputs, and the expected outputs. 
We call these schemas `Signatures`. DSPy automatically handles input formatting and output parsing. You can see the DSPy dataflow below.
## DSPy Dataflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Signature">
  Pass inputs when calling the `Predict` module as a function.
  ```python
  result = predict(question="What is the capital of France?")
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adapter">
    The Adapter transforms the inputs + signature into a messages list passed to the language model.
    <Accordion title="See Messages">
    ```python
    [
    {"role": "system", "content": """Your input fields are:  
    1. `question` (str):  
    Your output fields are:  
    1. `answer` (str):  
    All interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.  
    
    [[ ## question ## ]]  
    {question}  

    [[ ## answer ## ]]  
    {answer}  
    
    [[ ## completed ## ]]  
    In adhering to this structure, your objective is:   
    Given the fields `question`, produce the fields `answer`."""
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": """[[ ## question ## ]] 
    What is the capital of France?

    Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## answer ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`."""
    }
    ]
    ```
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="LM Call">
    Routes messages to the underlying language model via litellm and returns an updated messages list containing LM response.
    <Accordion title="See LM Response">
    ```python
    [
    {"role": "assistant", "content": """[[ ## answer ## ]]
    The capital of France is Paris.
    
    [[ ## completed ## ]]"""
    }
    ]
    ```
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adapter">
  The adapter parses the LM response into a dictionary and validates it against the signature's output fields.
  ```json
  {output: "The capital of France is Paris."}
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prediction">
  The `Predict` module formats the dict into a `Prediction` object. 
  ```python
  Prediction(output="The capital of France is Paris.")
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Context Library

Modaic provides several built-in context classes that you can use immediately or extend to create your own specialized contexts. These classes handle common data formats and implement useful behaviors for agent interactions.

## Built-in Context Classes

- **Text**: Represents in-memory text content. You can chunk it with `chunk_text()` and create instances directly from files using `Text.from_file()`. This class is ideal for small to medium-sized text that fits comfortably in memory.

- **TextFile**: Represents text backed by a `FileStore`. It loads content on demand through the `hydrate()` method, which makes it suitable for larger documents that shouldn't be fully serialized in database records.

- **Table**: Represents in-memory tabular data backed by pandas DataFrames. It provides methods like `markdown()` for rendering, `query()` for SQL-like operations, and `schema_info()` for metadata extraction.

- **TableFile**: Represents tabular data backed by a `FileStore`. It supports Excel files (xls/xlsx), CSV, and TSV formats, loading them into memory only when needed.

## Common Behaviors

- **Hydratable**: Context classes that implement the `hydrate(file_store)` method and use `HydratedAttr()` for fields. These contexts can load their data from files on demand, keeping database payloads small.

- **Embeddable**: Context classes that implement the `embedme()` method, which returns content suitable for embedding models. Some contexts implement `embedme(index)` to support multiple embedding types from a single context.

<Tip>
All built-in context classes are designed for inheritance. For example, you could create a `MarkdownFile` class that inherits from `TextFile` and implements specialized chunking logic for Markdown syntax. This approach allows you to reuse existing functionality while adding domain-specific features.

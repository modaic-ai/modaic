## DirectoryDatabase

```python
class DirectoryDatabase(ContextDatabase)
```

A database that stores context objects in a local file system directory. Not to be confused with the BucketDatabase in local mode.
This database is designed to be used in-place and in tandem with a user&#x27;s local folder.

## Welcome to Modaic 🐙

Never lose your progress again. Save everything you need to compare and reproduce optimization runs with GEPA, MIPROv2, etc. — architecture, hyperparameters, precompiled prompts, predictions, git commits, and even datasets — in 5 minutes. 
Modaic is free for personal use and academic projects, and it's easy to get started.

Modaic is a hub to share, manage, and track DSPy programs and their optimizations. Developers move faster with Modaic through:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Version Control, Checkpointing, Experiment Hygiene, & Reproducibility">
    Track changes to code, LM config, experiment-specific variables, and compiled prompts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evals">
    Distill human expertise into state-of-the-art scorers to evaluate your AI systems.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Composition">
    Load pre-optimized public or private DSPy programs from Modaic Hub to accelerate development.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installation

**Using uv (recommended)**

To use all features of Modaic, including modaic hub, you need to install using uv.
```bash
uv add modaic
```
**Using pip**

You can still use Modaic without uv, but you will not be able to upload DSPy programs to the Modaic Hub.

```bash
pip install modaic
```

Set your hub token (required for pushing/loading to/from the hub):

```bash
export MODAIC_TOKEN="<your-token>"
```

## Quickstart

### Create a PrecompiledProgram
```python
from modaic import PrecompiledProgram, PrecompiledConfig
from typing import Literal
import dspy

class SentimentSignature(dspy.Signature):
    text: str = dspy.InputField()
    sentiment: Literal["positive", "negative", "neutral"] = dspy.OutputField()

class SentimentAnalyzerConfig(PrecompiledConfig):
    lm: str = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"

class SentimentAnalyzer(PrecompiledProgram):
    config: SentimentAnalyzerConfig # ! Important: config must be annotated with the config class forward references are not supported

    def __init__(self, config: SentimentAnalyzerConfig, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(config, **kwargs)
        self.predict = dspy.Predict(SentimentSignature)
        self.predict.set_lm(lm=dspy.LM(model=self.config.lm))

    def forward(self, text: str) -> str:
        return self.predict(text=text)

program = SentimentAnalyzer(SentimentAnalyzerConfig())
prediction = program(text="I love this product!")
print(prediction.sentiment)
>>> positive
```

### Save locally

```python
program.save_precompiled("./my-echo")

# Load 
program_loaded = SentimentAnalyzer.from_precompiled("./my-echo")
print(loaded(text="I hate this product!"))
>>> negative
```

### Push to the hub

<Warning>
Pushing to the hub requires setting the `MODAIC_TOKEN` environment variable.
</Warning>

```python
# Requires MODAIC_TOKEN; pushes to "<your-username>/sentiment-analyzer"
program = SentimentAnalyzer(SentimentAnalyzerConfig())
# Optimization script here ...
# program = optimizer.compile(program)
program.push_to_hub("<your-username>/sentiment-analyzer", commit_message="initial module")

# Load 
loaded_program = SentimentAnalyzer.from_precompiled("<your-username>/sentiment-analyzer")
print(loaded_program(text="I hate this product!"))
>>> negative
```

## Load a Third Party Program

```python
from modaic import AutoProgram

# Load a precompiled receipt classifier from the Modaic Hub
receipt_classifier = AutoProgram.from_precompiled(
    "farouk1/receipt-classifier", config={"max_tokens": 500}
)
```

Run this program
<Into>
To run this program set the environment variables `MODAIC_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
</Into>

```python
# Analyze a receipt image and extract the total cost
results = receipt_classifier("https://ocr.space/Content/Images/receipt-ocr-original.webp")

print(results.total_cost)  # Output: 98.21
```
## Push a Bundled Program

To allow others to use your program you can push a package with the program's code and dependencies included.

```python
program.push_to_hub("yourname/program-name", with_code=True)
```

<Warning>
`with_code=True` may fail if you haven't set up your workspace correctly. See the [Packaging Guide](/guides/programs/packaging_a_program) for more details.
